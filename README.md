# Exploratory-data-analysis
# Project 1

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

I.  Dataset: Electric power consumption
II. Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4  years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
